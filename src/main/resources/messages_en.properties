descricao.texto=Oralytics is an innovative platform designed for oral health monitoring, developed with a strong focus on prevention, well-being, and intelligent data analysis. Through the systematic recording of daily habits, such as dietary patterns, oral hygiene routines, and other health-related behaviors, combined with the automated analysis of dental images, the system is capable of generating personalized reports and specific guidance tailored to the individual profile of each user. This modern approach allows users to monitor their oral health in real-time, identifying potential risks before they evolve into more serious issues. Additionally, it offers essential support for dental professionals, aiding in clinical decision-making based on concrete and up-to-date data. The primary goal of Oralytics is to promote a significant reduction in dental-related incidents, optimize preventive care, and enhance the overall quality of oral health services. By leveraging advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Predictive Analytics, the platform positions itself as a smart, scalable, and highly valuable solution for both patients and specialists.Within this web portal, you will have access to some of the core features that will be available in the final version of the software, which is being developed specifically for mobile devices. This environment serves as an interactive showcase and testing space, allowing users to explore the systems capabilities and better understand its purpose. Authentication is carried out by creating an account. Depending on the type of account, whether ADMIN or USER, different levels of access permissions are granted:ADMIN accounts have administrative privileges that allow users to perform actions such as registering new data or deleting existing information. These operations are conducted through POST and DELETE requests and are primarily intended for professionals or system administrators.USER accounts, on the other hand, are designed for regular users who simply wish to view the available information. These accounts are limited to GET requests, meaning they can read but not modify data.Within this portal, users can access and manage various features, including user management, dental analyses, monitoring data, reports of dental problems, and more. These functionalities reflect the key features of the Mobile version of the system. We invite you to freely explore the possibilities offered and gain a deeper understanding of our solutions proposal. Oralytics, your intelligent ally in oral health.
